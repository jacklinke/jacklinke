### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [watervize](https://www.watervize.com), a B2B2B/C SaaS that helps Irrigation Districts manage their resources, improve efficiency, and communicate with their customers 💧

A few django packages I've developed (I welcome collaboration (PRs & Issues)):

- 1️2️3️ My latest project, [django-generate-series](https://github.com/jacklinke/django-generate-series), makes it easier to use Postgres' generate_series to create sequences with Django's ORM
- ℹ️ [django-model-info](https://github.com/jacklinke/django-model-info) provides a Django Management Command for displaying details about your project's models such as listing model fields, relations, methods, and more
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on graph representations in Postgresql databases. I'm porting and expanding the functionality of my django package for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) ([django-postgresql-dag](https://www.github.com/OmenApps/django-postgresql-dag)) into a new project, [django-directed](https://github.com/jacklinke/django-directed). It's still very much a work in progress, but will be more generalized to working with all types of directed graphs.

Some other details:

- 💬 Ask me about [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) or [HTMX](https://htmx.org/).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about applied graph theory, advanced PDF generation tools, etc
- 🪄 I have contributed (often in small ways) to a multitude of open source projects, and moderate some online programming resources
- 🤓 Speaking about technology interests and helping others learn is something I love. Let me know if your organization, conference, or meetup might have an opportunity that I could contribute toward.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun facts: I'm an active duty Marine Corps officer 🪖, a radar technician and subject matter expert in systems maintenance 🤖, married to my bff 🌈, and I'm passionate about the topics of data storytelling and visualization 📈

I had been committing as [@OmenApps](https://www.github.com/OmenApps/), but I'm working on separating myself and my personal account from busness interests.
