### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I am currently working on [Watervize](https://www.watervize.com), a B2B2B/C SaaS that helps Irrigation Districts manage their resources, improve efficiency, report on water usage, and communicate with their customers 💧

#### A few django packages I've developed (I welcome collaboration (PRs & Issues)):

- 🔢 My latest project, [django-generate-series](https://github.com/OmenApps/django-generate-series), makes it easier to use Postgres' generate_series to create sequences with Django's ORM
- ℹ️ [django-model-info](https://github.com/OmenApps/django-model-info) provides a Django Management Command for displaying details about your project's models such as listing model fields, relations, methods, and more
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on graph representations in Postgresql databases. I'm porting and expanding the functionality of my django package for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) ([django-postgresql-dag](https://www.github.com/OmenApps/django-postgresql-dag)) into a new project, [django-directed](https://github.com/OmenApps/django-directed). It's still very much a work in progress, but will be more generalized to working with all types of directed graphs.

I had been committing as [@OmenApps / @JackAtOmenApps](https://www.github.com/JackAtOmenApps/), but I'm working on separating myself and my personal account (with WIPs, drafts, personal repos, etc) from busness interests and more professional pursuits. The repositories that my small business maintains are located at [OmenApps](https://www.github.com/OmenApps/).
