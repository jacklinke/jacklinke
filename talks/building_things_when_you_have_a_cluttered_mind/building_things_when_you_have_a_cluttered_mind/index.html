					<p>Traditional recommendations:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Somewhere comfortable <span class="muted-red">(I would be drowsy)</span></li>
						<li>And quiet <span class="muted-red">(silence can be deafening)</span>	</li>
						<li>With nothing distracting nearby <span class="muted-red">(boooooring)</span></li>

					<p>Experiment to find the environment that works for you</p>

					<p>I get the best work done when:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Working in public</li>
						<li>At a busy coffeeshop</li>
						<li>With noise-canceling headphones</li>
					</ul>

					<p>This was a revelation for me ü§Ø</p>

					<p>Society feeds us a lot of expectations about how our:</p>

					<p><b>Forgive yourself</b></p>

					<ul>
						<li>Life isn't about the # of things you can accomplish</li>
						<li>Not every project needs to be finished</li>
						<li>The journey and experience are valuable</li>
						<li>And, you can almost always go back to that idea or project in the future...</li>

					<p>Take notes - be religious about this</p>

					<ul>
						<li>If I don't write it down, it is not real</li>
						<li class="muted-red"><b>Have *some way* to write notes wherever you are - bed, work, bathroom, etc</b></li>

					<p>Set future-you up for success. Write down:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Every random thought on the project</li>
						<li>Research you've done</li>
						<li>Work you've completed</li>
						<li>Where you stopped</li>
						<li>Where documents/code/media are located</li>
						<li>How to get the working environment reestablished</li>
						<li>Any context that will help get you restarted quickly</li>

					<p>Keep your list of projects and associated notes where you can easily find it</p>

					<p>If you one day have energy and interest again, this list can help you be productive on *something* cool, even if its not the thing you should be working on üòÖ</p>

					<p>Look back occasionally - you are doing more than it might feel like in the moment</p>

					<p>In the past 5 years I *have* failed to achieve many things I set out to do, but I've:</p>

					<small>
						<ul>
							<li>Built a business & developed a powerful data system with Django</li>
							<li>Gave speeches about django & other topics</li>
							<li>Created many tools for work</li>
							<li>Contributed to OSS projects, including Django</li>
						</ul>

					<hr>

					<p>But more importantly:</p>
						
					<small>
						<ul>
							<li>Provided for my family</li>
							<li>Mentored young women and men in the military</li>
							<li>Kept our husky alive and thriving (and spoiled)</li>
							<li>Made wonderful friends in the django community</li>
						</ul>

					<h6>4. Getting help</h6>
					<hr>

					<p>Needing help is normal & human, <br>and seeking help is healthy.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						I hope the thoughts I have shared here will help some of you, or get you thinking about what things you might change in your life and in your mental models of the world to make your life more meaningful, build the things that are important to you, and accept that you won't finish everything. Most importantly, I hope that you will seek help when you're struggling with a mental disorder, addiction, anxiety, or any of the other myriad things that can affect us and are completely valid reasons for seeking help.
